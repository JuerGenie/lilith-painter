# LILITH-PAINTER

---

### WHAT

LILITH-PAINTER is an easy tool for Paint API (Houdini APIs).

Use this module to easy register paint and worklet with typescript.



### WHY

When I ready to try Paint API with typescript, something is holding me back â€“ Houdini APIs missing type definitions.

I'm searching type definitions on `google`, `stack-overflow`, `github`and `npmjs` but never result. So I thought, why don't I write something to help myself?

So, It's LILITH-PAINTER, declare Houdini APIs' type (in file `src/houdini.d.ts`) but not all, just a part of I will need. If you want other, welcome to complete the part that you need, thank you very much!

*Ah, If anybody know where I can found the type definitions, say to me please.*



### HOW TO USE?

#### FOR USER

1. Install LILITH-PAINTER:

   ```sh
   npm install lilith-painter
   ```

2. Use typescript, like this:

   ```typescript
   import { register, IsStyleValue } from "lilith-painter";
   
   register(
     "lilith-transition", 
     {
       name: "--lilith-transition-color",
       inherits: true,
       syntax: "<color>",
       initialValue: "#000",
       ...IsStyleValue,
     },
     (ctx, geom, properties) => {
       // draw something...
     });
   ```
